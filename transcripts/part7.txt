(Kiki's bedroom...)

KIKI:         ......Jiji, something's wrong with me.  After finally
              making a friend, I suddenly became spiteful.  It seemed
              like the quiet and cheerful Kiki disappeared...(Jiji
              walks off)...?  How cold hearted...

(Dinnertime...)

KIKI:         Jiji, no matter how nice a friend you've met, I wish
              you'd be on time for dinner.  I can never finish
              cleaning up.

JIJI:         Meow...

KIKI:         What's with you, talking like a cat?

JIJI:         Meow...

KIKI:         ...Jiji, what happened to your voice?   Say 'Kiki',
              Jiji!  Jiji!  (Jiji walks off)  I wonder what happened?
              It seems that I can't understand Jiji...Oh, no!

KIKI:         My magic has gotten weak.

(The next morning...)

OSONO:        You can't fly?  Because your magic has disappeared?

KIKI:         It's gotten very weak.  I'll have to cancel my delivery
              service.  But then, I'll help full-time at the shop.
              Please let me stay in that room.

OSONO:        Well, that's no problem.  Your magic powers will
              return, won't they?

KIKI:         I don't know, though I can make another broom.

BAKER:        (sees the dirigible flying overhead)  Hey!

(Tombo is talking to Kiki on the phone...)

TOMBO:        Kiki?  It's Tombo.  Did you see me waving from the
              dirigible today?  The captain let us go on a test
              flight.  It was fantastic!  Hello, hello?  Are you
              listening, Kiki?

KIKI:         Don't call me anymore.  (hangs up)

TOMBO:        Huh?  What?  I can't hear you.  The captain wants to
              meet you.  ...?  Hello, Hello?!

OSONO:        What's the matter, Kiki?  You're as white as a sheet.

KIKI:         I'm still in my training period.  If my magic
              disappears, there's nothing else I know how to do.

(Ursula drops by...)

URSULA:       Kiki!  Hi!  Hey, you didn't come to visit me at all,
              so I came myself.

KIKI:         I'm sorry.

URSULA:       Well, that's not true.  I'm on a shopping trip, so I
              stopped in.

KIKI:         Come on in.  I'm between chores.

URSULA:       Of course.  That's what I planned to do.

(In Kiki's room...)

URSULA:       This is a pretty nice room.

KIKI:         Have some if you like.  I'll make some tea.

URSULA:       No tea for me.  Could I have milk, if you have some?

KIKI:         Sure.

URSULA:       (to Jiji)  Aha, it's true!  Exactly like that stuffed
              cat!  You're Jiji, aren't you?  (to Kiki)  How's the
              business?  Are you on the right track?  It's not going
              well?

KIKI:         I'm taking a little time off.

URSULA:       Oh?

(Later...)

URSULA:       On the street, I thought you looked a little
              down-hearted.  So that sort of thing happens to
              witches, too?  Look, why don't you come and stay at
              my cabin?

KIKI:         What?

URSULA:       Excuse yourself with the shop-lady.  One day won't
              hurt.  Jiji, won't you come, too?  (laughs)  Rather
              be with her, huh?  OK, decide.  Let's go right away.

(At the bus terminal...)

URSULA:       It's here!

(On a hill...)

URSULA:       Made it.

KIKI:         How beautiful...!

(Hitchhiking...)

URSULA:       What gives?  Doesn't this beautiful girl catch
              anyone's eye?

(In the truck...)

URSULA:       What?!  You thought I was a boy??

DRIVER:       Well, you looked like one.

URSULA:       And you didn't notice these beautiful legs?

(At the cabin...)

KIKI:         The crows...

URSULA:       We've become good friends.  Ya-hoo, I'm home!

KIKI:         Good day.  Please forgive me about last time.

URSULA:       Go on in.  I'll get some water.

(Inside the cabin...)

URSULA:       Well?

KIKI:         It's wonderful...

URSULA:       When I met you, I got the inspiration to paint this
              picture.  But you know, I can't get this girl's face
              just right.  I've been waiting for you to come.

KIKI:         Is this me?

URSULA:       Well, I guess.  Sit there a minute.  Will you be my
              model?

KIKI:         But I'm not that beautiful.

URSULA:       (laughs) You have a fine face.  It's a lot nicer now
              than before.  Now, sit there.  That chair is okay.
              Raise your head a little, like you're looking off into
              the distance.  That's it; hold it.

              Magic and painting are a lot alike.  You know, a lot
              of times, I just can't paint.

KIKI:         Really?  When that happens, what do you do?

URSULA:       No, no.  Don't look over here.

KIKI:         Before, I could fly without giving it a thought.
              But now, I don't know how I did it.

URSULA:       When that happens, all one can do is struggle through
              it.  I draw and draw, and keep drawing.

KIKI:         But then, if I can't fly...

URSULA:       Then I stop drawing.  I take walks, look at the
              scenery, take naps, do nothing.  Then after a while,
              all of a sudden I get the urge to draw again.

KIKI:         I wonder if that will happen?

URSULA:       It will.  Hey, look to the side.

(Bedtime...)

URSULA:       I decided to become an artist when I was about your
              age.  I liked to draw so much, I almost hated to go
              to bed.  And then one day, all of a sudden, I couldn't
              draw anything.  Everything I drew, I didn't like.

KIKI:         Hm...

URSULA:       I realized that my art up to then was a copy of
              someone else, things I had seen somewhere.  I decided
              I had to discover my own style.

KIKI:         Was it difficult?

URSULA:       It's still difficult.  But then, the results...They
              seem to be a little better than before.

URSULA:       Then, witches don't go around casting spells?

KIKI:         No, they say it's just something passed on
              to offspring.

URSULA:       It's nice to be a witch, isn't it?  I like the idea--
              to be a witch, to be an artist, to be a baker...It's an
              energy bestowed by the gods or someone, right?  Though
              thanks to it, we do have to suffer at times...

KIKI:         I never even thought about my magic powers.  I used
              to think this training was just an old-fashioned
              custom...I was so happy you came today.  If I were
              alone, I'd just be running around in circles.

URSULA:       You know, to tell you the truth, I thought about
              destroying this painting many times.

KIKI:         Even though it's so beautiful?

URSULA:       When I met you today, and saw your distressed face,
              I thought, 'That's it', and I was inspired.

KIKI:         Tease!

URSULA:       (laughs)  Now we're even.

URSULA:       OK, I'm going to turn it off.

KIKI:         Um.  I'm sorry I'm taking your bed.

URSULA:       That's OK.

KIKI:         Is it all right if I come and visit some time?

URSULA:       Sure.  I'm here during the summer.  And I'll go and
              visit you sometime, too.

KIKI:         Right.
