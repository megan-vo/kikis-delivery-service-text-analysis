(At the clock tower...)

CARETAKER:    Hey, a witch!  Isn't that something!

KIKI:         Good morning.  Is there a witch in this town?

CARETAKER:    Hmm...I haven't seen one for a long time.

KIKI:         (to Jiji)  Did you hear that?  I've decided on this
              town.  Thanks, mister!

CARETAKER:    Not at all!...

JIJI:         You really want to go down there?

KIKI:         Of course!

JIJI:         They're all looking.

KIKI:         Smile.  We have to make a good first impression.

(On the street...)

KIKI:         Ahem...I'm Kiki, a witch, and this black cat is Jiji.
              I hope I'm not intruding.  I'd like to live in this
              town.  It's beautiful, and the clock tower is
              wonderful.

WOMAN-BYSTANDER:    (nonplussed)  Really?  I'm so glad you like it here.

(A policeman approaches her on the run.)

COP:          Hey, you!   You can't jump out in the street like that!
              You almost caused a big accident!   Flying around town
              like that is dangerous.

KIKI:         But I'm a witch.  All witches fly.

COP:          Witches have to obey the traffic laws like everyone
              else.  Your name and address?

KIKI:         You're going to notify my home?

COP:          You're a minor, aren't you.  I will if I have to.

(Voice):      Thief!  Thief!...Thief!!

COP:          You wait right here!

(On a side street...)

JIJI:         Kiki...

TOMBO:        Hey, there...That worked out great, didn't it?
              I'm the one who yelled out "Thief!"  You're a witch,
              aren't you?  I saw you flying.

              So you really do fly on a broom.  Say, will you
              let me see it?


BOYS:         Tombo!  Hunting girls so early in the morning?

TOMBO:        Idiots!  Oops...

TOMBO:        Hey, please, for just a minute, OK?

KIKI:         Thank you for saving me.  But I didn't ask for your
              help.  And when you haven't been properly introduced,
              it's rude to start talking to a girl.  Hmph!

TOMBO:        You're really a witch, aren't you...just like my
              grandmother.

KIKI:         Don't follow me!

(Kiki flies away...)

TOMBO:        Ah...Cool!


(In a hotel...)

HOTEL-CLERK:  A room?  Is there a guardian with you?

KIKI:         I'm a witch.  Witches become independent when they
              turn 13.

HOTEL-CLERK:  Well then, may I see some identification?

KIKI:         Never mind.

(At the monument...)

JIJI:         Aren't you going to eat?

KIKI:         If you want it, you can have it.

JIJI:         It'll be evening soon.

KIKI:         Let's go.
