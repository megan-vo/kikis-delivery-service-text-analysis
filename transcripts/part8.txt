(The next morning, at the bakery...)

TV:           The dirigible "Spirit of Freedom", that landed in this
              town due to the heavy rainstorm, has finished its
              repairs and will continue its journey to the South Pole.
              We plan to broadcast the departure live, from the
              seaside park.

OSONO:        (answering the phone)  Yes, this is the Gutiokipanja
              bakery.  Oh, Kiki.  Yes.  But you should take more
              time...Oh, yes.  The lady you met the other day wants
              you to stop over again.  What do you want to do?
              Shall I turn her down?  I told her you were on
              vacation for awhile, but she insists...Really?
              Then stop in on your way back.  Bye.


(At the madam's house...)

KIKI:         Good day.

BERTHA:       Well, well, come in.  We've been waiting eagerly.

TV:           It's almost 5 minutes until departure.  The city's
              "Seahorse Band" is playing, and the crew is waving
              to the crowd below.  The group of people holding the
              rope are eagerly awaiting the departure signal.
              The final check seems almost complete...

KIKI:         Here I am, Madam.

MADAM:        Welcome.  Please excuse me for not getting up.  The
              weather's nice but my legs are bothering me.  Bertha,
              would you bring it?

BERTHA:       Yes, yes.  Madam, has it taken off yet?

MADAM:        Not yet.  Isn't it funny?  She's crazy about
              dirigibles.

BERTHA:       It's the adventure that I like.

MADAM:        Would you turn the sound down a bit?  Kiki, would you
              open this box?

KIKI:         All right.  Madam, this...

MADAM:        I'd like that delivered to a person named Kiki,
              because she did a big favor for me the other day.  It's
              my way of saying "Thank you'.  I'd also be happy if
              at the same time you would find out her birthday.
              Then I can bake another cake...  Kiki...

KIKI:         I'm very sure that person will want to know Madam's
              birthday, too.  It would be fun, thinking of a present.

MADAM:        That's true, isn't it.

KIKI:         (laughs)

TV:           It's a gust of wind.  A gale...Oh!

MADAM:        What happened?

BERTHA:       It seems like there was an accident.

TV:           It's serious trouble!  The rope has broken!!  The
              dirigible is being blown away.  Ah, it's coming towards
              our broadcast truck!
              Oh, no!!

BERTHA:       Ah, at the most important moment...what are they
              showing!?

MADAM:        These strong winds sometimes come up in the summer.
              It will come by here in a minute.

BERTHA:       Madam!  The picture's back.  It's upside down!!

TV:           We're here at the seaside park...Blown by a sudden gust
              of wind, the "Spirit of Freedom" is almost touching
              ground...

BERTHA:       When you come right down to it, it's just a balloon.

TV:           It's lost its balance, and the ship is now upside down.
              They're doing their best to anchor the last rope
              holding the dirigible.  I wonder if they can hold the
              ship;  it looks like it's ready to float away.   Ahh,
              it's no good...

              The tremendous lift of the helium gas is pulling the
              dirigible higher and higher.  The powerful force of
              the helium matched against several hundred people...

KIKI:         Tombo!!  That boy's a friend of mine!

TV:           It's throwing off people one by one, and floating
              higher and higher.  Ah, even a patrol car is being
              carried away like a toy.  What's going to happen...?!

              A young boy is being carried away with a patrol car!
              This is terrible!  Who would have thought something
              like this would happen?!

KIKI:         Tombo!

MADAM:        You say he's a friend of yours?

KIKI:         I have to go.

MADAM:        Be careful!

BERTHA:       How terrible!

(The dirigible...)

CAPTAIN:      Hold on!  Don't let go!   (to crew)  Release helium
              from the rear compartments!  Hurry!!

(On the street...)

RADIO:        The helium in the dirigible will not explode.
              Townspeople, don't panic and move about calmly.

KIKI:         How's Tombo?...Is the boy all right?!

MAN IN CAR:   I don't know, but they said the patrol car fell.

FIRETRUCK:    Move aside!  Open up the street!  Clear the way!

STREET
SWEEPER:      Are you OK?

KIKI:         Mister, please lend me that broom!

STREET
SWEEPER:      Huh?

KIKI:         Please!  I promise to return it!

STREET
SWEEPER:      Well, I guess...

KIKI:         Thank you!

KIKI:         Fly!!

BYSTANDER:    She's flying...!

(In the air...)

KIKI:         Fly straight, or I'll throw you in the fire!

ANNOUNCER:    Nothing has happened to the boy yet, but the "Spirit of
              Freedom" is being blown by the wind and is approaching
              the city tower.
              If it continues, it'll crash into the tower...

TOMBO:        We're going to hit!  More altitude!

CAPTAIN:      We don't have enough gas!  Before we crash, jump into
              the tower!

TOMBO:        I'll try!

CARETAKER:    Hey!  Come over here!

TOMBO:        Mister!  Get away!

CARETAKER:    Grab this!

(Kiki, above the town...)

KIKI:         Fly faster!  Hey!!

ANNOUNCER:    Listen to that!  It's the tremendous noise of the gas
              escaping.  We can't see from here what happened to the
              young lad.

              It's going to fall!  The gas is escaping!  The
              dirigible is going to fall!!  It's caught!  It stopped!
              It's been stopped!  Look, the lad is still there!  It's
              a miracle!  The lad is still hanging there!  But then,
              how are they going to save him?  If they don't do
              something, that brave lad...

(The town square...)

ANNOUNCER:    What, what was that?!  A bird...No, it's a young girl!
              A young girl is flying through the air!!  It's a witch!
              It's not a broom!  It's a witch riding on a push broom!!

(The madam's house...)

MADAM:        It's Kiki!

BERTHA:       Go!

(The bakery...)

OSONO:        That child, she's flying!

(The house on the cape...)

KETTO:        Go get him!!

KIKI:         TOMBO!!

TOMBO:        KIKI!!

KIKI:         (to the broom)  Listen, you're a good boy, so do as I
              tell you!

CAPTAIN:      Keep trying!  Just a bit more!!

KIKI:         TOMBO!!

TOMBO:        KIKI!!

ANNOUNCER:    You can do it!  Just a bit more!

CROWD:        Go get him!  Go get him!  Go get him!!

CAPTAIN:      You can do it!

ANNOUNCER:    She caught him!!  She caught him in mid-air!!

              They've just touched down!  It's an emotional scene!
              It looks like the crew of the dirigible is safe too!

STREET-
SWEEPER:      I lent her that push-broom, you know!


(Madam's house...)

MADAM:        (laughs)  Ahh!...Stop it, Bertha!

BERTHA:       She did it, she did it!!...(laughs)


(At the bakery...)

OSONO:        Good girl, Kiki!  Good for you!

              Dear!!  Call the doctor!  I think it's time!

BAKER:        Oi!!...


(EPILOGUE:  At Kiki's home village:)

OKINO:        Mother!!  It's a letter from Kiki!

OKINO:        (reading letter)  Father, Mother, how are you?   Jiji
              and I are both very well.  (Kiki's voice:) My work's on
              the right track and I'm confident.  It's been hard
              sometimes, but I love this town.
