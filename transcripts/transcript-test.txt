RADIO:        ...Now for the weather report from Northwest
              Karikiya.  A high pressure system over land will bring
              good weather overall.  Tonight, the wind will be from
              the west by northwest, wind pressure 3, clear, with a
              beautiful full moon.  Tomorrow should be clear, and
              also the day after.  Next, the futures prices from
              the Karikiya Central Produce Market...

KIKI:         Jiji!  I've decided!  I'm leaving tonight!


KIKI:         Mother!!  (to Mrs. Dora) Oh, good day!  Mother, did you
              hear the weather forecast?  It's going to clear tonight.
              There'll be a beautiful moon!

KOKIRI:       Kiki, did you take Father's radio out again?

KIKI:         Well, he won't mind. (to Mrs. Dora)  Mrs. Dora, how
              are you?  I've made up my mind, I'm going to do it
              tonight.

KOKIRI:       But, dear, you said you were going to postpone it for a
              month...

KIKI:         But I don't know if the next full moon will be clear.
              I want to depart on a clear night.

KOKIRI:       Ah...Wait a minute!  Kiki!  <poof!>

DORA:         Do witches have to leave home as part of their
              training?

KOKIRI:       Yes, it's an old custom.  If a child wants to be a witch,
              she leaves home when she turns 13.

DORA:         How soon.  So Kiki is at that age already?

KOKIRI:       But to leave home alone so young, it won't do in this
              day and age.

DORA:         I remember well the day you came to this town.  A tiny,
              13-year-old girl riding on a broom, dropping out of the
              sky.  Eyes sparkling, a bit saucy...

KOKIRI:       But that child, all she's mastered is flying.  And
              there'll be no one to carry on my medicine-making.

DORA:         It's the fault of the times.  Everything's changing.
              But for me and my rheumatism, your medicine works the
              best.
