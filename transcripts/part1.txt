RADIO:        ...Now for the weather report from Northwest
              Karikiya.  A high pressure system over land will bring
              good weather overall.  Tonight, the wind will be from
              the west by northwest, wind pressure 3, clear, with a
              beautiful full moon.  Tomorrow should be clear, and
              also the day after.  Next, the futures prices from
              the Karikiya Central Produce Market...

(At home...)

KIKI:         Jiji!  I've decided!  I'm leaving tonight!


KIKI:         Mother!!  (to Mrs. Dora) Oh, good day!  Mother, did you
              hear the weather forecast?  It's going to clear tonight.
              There'll be a beautiful moon!

KOKIRI:       Kiki, did you take Father's radio out again?

KIKI:         Well, he won't mind. (to Mrs. Dora)  Mrs. Dora, how
              are you?  I've made up my mind, I'm going to do it
              tonight.

KOKIRI:       But, dear, you said you were going to postpone it for a
              month...

KIKI:         But I don't know if the next full moon will be clear.
              I want to depart on a clear night.

KOKIRI:       Ah...Wait a minute!  Kiki!  <poof!>

DORA:         Do witches have to leave home as part of their
              training?

KOKIRI:       Yes, it's an old custom.  If a child wants to be a witch,
              she leaves home when she turns 13.

DORA:         How soon.  So Kiki is at that age already?

KOKIRI:       But to leave home alone so young, it won't do in this
              day and age.

DORA:         I remember well the day you came to this town.  A tiny,
              13-year-old girl riding on a broom, dropping out of the
              sky.  Eyes sparkling, a bit saucy...

KOKIRI:       But that child, all she's mastered is flying.  And
              there'll be no one to carry on my medicine-making.

DORA:         It's the fault of the times.  Everything's changing.
              But for me and my rheumatism, your medicine works the
              best.

(In Kiki's bedroom...)

KIKI:         Well, you were so eager to depart, and now that the
              time has come, you're sure dilly-dallying.

JIJI:         No, it's not that.  After all, it's the beginning of
              your independence, and you should be more cautious
              and calm.

KIKI:         So, what'll I do if I wait a month and in the meantime
              find a nice boyfriend?  It'll be too hard to leave then.

JIJI:         It's always a worry, what'll happen, because once you
              decide, you're such an impulsive person.

KIKI:         Well, I guess I am.  I'm all excited, like when I'm
              about to open up a gift.

(Kiki's dad arrives...)

KIKI:         Father, I've decided to leave tonight.

OKINO:        What did you say??

KIKI:         I decided, just a little while ago.

OKINO:        But look, I borrowed the camping equipment for next
              week...

KIKI:         I'm sorry.

OKINO:        This won't do!  Ah...Ah!


(Okino is on the telephone...)

OKINO:        Thank you.  We'll be waiting.  (dials)
              This is Okino.  Kiki's leaving tonight...
              Yes, that's right.

(In Kiki's bedroom...)

KOKIRI:       It looks nice, doesn't it?

KIKI:         If only it were purple...

KOKIRI:       Witches have worn that since long ago.

KIKI:         A black cat, black clothes...I'm all in black.

KOKIRI:       Kiki, don't worry so much about your appearance.
              What's important is the 'inner soul'.

KIKI:         Yes, I understand.  Leave the 'inner soul' part to me.
              It's too bad I can't show it to you.

KOKIRI:       And don't forget to always smile.

KIKI:         O-kay!

KOKIRI:       And write us a letter as soon as you're settled.

(Kokiri leaves, and Okino walks in...)

KIKI:         Father!  May I have that radio?  All right?
              The radio?!  Hooray!!

OKINO:        (laughs)  I finally lost it...
              Hey, let me see my little witch.  You look a
              lot like your mother
              when she was younger.

KIKI:         Father, lift me up 'high-high', like when I was small.

OKINO:        All right.  (lifts her)  When did you get so big?...
              If it doesn't go well, you can always return home.

KIKI:         That's not going to happen.

OKINO:        It'll be nice if you find a nice town.

KIKI:         Right.

(Evening, on the patio...)

NEIGHBOR A:   That's hard--to find a town to live in by yourself.

NEIGHBOR B:   Kiki will do fine.

FRIEND A:     What kind of town will you choose?

FRIEND B:     A big city?

KIKI:         Well, I'm planning to find a town overlooking
              the ocean.

FRIENDS:      Oh, how wonderful.  We're jealous!

KIKI:         But I'm going for my training.  I can't become a
              witch unless I live for one year in another town.

FRIEND C:     But there'll be a disco there, won't there?

KOKIRI:       Kiki, it's time.

KIKI:         All right.

KOKIRI:       Dear, are you going with that broom?

KIKI:         Yes, I just made it.  Isn't it cute?

KOKIRI:       It won't do; it's so small.  Take Mother's broom.

KIKI:         Oh, no!  It's so old.

KOKIRI:       That's why it's just right.  It's been through a lot,
              and will weather any storm.  Take it, OK?

KIKI:         But I worked so hard to make this one.  Right, Jiji?

JIJI:         I think your mother's broom is better...

KIKI:         Backstabber!

DORA:         Kiki, when you get settled in your new town, you can
              make your own, can't you?

KIKI:         (Resignedly)  Well... (switches brooms with Kokiri)

OKINO:        Be careful.

KOKIRI:       Chin up.

KIKI:         I'll be off.

KOKIRI:       Do your best!   Take it easy!  Be sure to write!

FRIENDS:      Go, go, Kiki!   Go, go, Kiki!  Go, go, Kiki...!

(Kiki takes off...)

KOKIRI:       Oh, clumsy as always!

OKINO:        (listening with hands cupped)  It's OK.  I think she's
              off without any trouble.

NEIGHBOR:     I guess we won't be hearing those bells for awhile...


(Over the town...)

JIJI:         Which way are we going?

KIKI:         To the south, where  we can see the ocean.

KIKI:         Jiji!  Turn on the radio, my hands are busy!  Hurry!

(The credits roll...)

(Over the lake...)

KIKI:         Good evening.

WITCH:        Well, well...Are you a newcomer?

KIKI:         Yes, I just departed this evening.

WITCH:        Would you mind turning off that music?  I like to
              fly in silence.

KIKI:         Oh.  Is it hard to settle down in a strange
              town?

WITCH:        Well, there were problems.  But I can tell fortunes,
              so it's going all right.

KIKI:         Fortune-telling...

WITCH:        And lately, I've been telling love-fortunes.

KIKI:         Really?

WITCH:        What's your specialty?

KIKI:         Well, I've been thinking about various things.

WITCH:        Oh?  I'll be through with my training soon.  I'm so
              glad I can return  home with my head held high.
              (points down)  That's my town.  It's not big, but
              it's all right.  And you too, do your best.

KIKI:         I will.

WITCH:        (Departing with a flourish...)  Well, bye!

JIJI:         What a snob!  Did you see that cat?  Ehh...

KIKI:         A specialty...


(A sudden rainstorm...)

KIKI:         What the...!   That weather report!!


JIJI:         That's no good!  It's a freight train.

KIKI:         Let's rest a bit until the rain stops.

JIJI:         Won't we get a scolding?

KIKI:         Well, if we're discovered.  I'm soaking wet.

JIJI:         Is it swaying?

KIKI:         Um...it smells good.

(The next morning...)

KIKI:         Ah, Ah!  (laughs hysterically)

KIKI:         Sorry, I didn't know it was your dinner.

(Atop the boxcar...)

KIKI:         Jiji, it's the sea, the sea!  How wonderful!
              It's my first view of the sea!

JIJI:         Big deal!  It's just a lot of water.

KIKI:         Look, look!  A big town!  I wonder if there's a
              witch there?

JIJI:         Hmm...I wonder.

(Kiki prepares to take off from the train...)

KIKI:         Here we go.

KIKI:         Jiji, are you holding on?

KIKI:         Look!  It's a town right by the sea!  A
              clocktower!  I wanted to live in a town
              like this!

JIJI:         But there may be a witch here already.

KIKI:         And there may not be.   Isn't it beautiful?

JIJI:         This town's a little too big.
