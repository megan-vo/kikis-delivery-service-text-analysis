(At the bakery...)

OSONO:        That was quite a downpour.  That boy waited a long time.

KIKI:         It's too late now.  I can't go like this anyway.

(In Kiki's bedroom...)

JIJI:         What's the matter, Kiki?  Have a headache?  Let's eat,
              I'm hungry.

(The next morning...)

OSONO:        KIKI!

(Upstairs...)

OSONO:        Are you feeling sick?...What a fever!

KIKI:         My head's throbbing.

OSONO:        Last night, you didn't dry off completely, did you?

KIKI:         I think I'm going to die...

OSONO:        (laughs) It's just a cold.  I'll  bring you some
              medicine.  And also, you'll have to eat something.

KIKI:         I'm not hungry.

OSONO:        It's better to eat a little, even if you don't want to.
              I'll make you some milk-gruel.  Some for Jiji, too.

(A little later...)

OSONO:        This is best when one has a cold.  Here, Jiji.  It's
              hot, so be careful.  (to Kiki:)  Now, eat some while
              it's hot.  Can you get up?

KIKI:         Do I absolutely have to?

OSONO:        Well, if you want to get healthy again.  Oh, yes.  That
              boy came to the shop a little while ago.  When I told
              him you were sick, he said, "You mean witches get sick
              too?"  He wants to visit you later.  What do you
              want to do?

KIKI:         No, no!

OSONO:        I thought you'd say that, so I turned him down
              politely.  You have a good rest;  you overtaxed
              yourself.  I'll open the window, OK?

KIKI:         Mrs. Osono?...Oh, nothing.


(The next morning...)

KIKI:         JIJI...JIJI!!

JIJI:         What?

KIKI:         Jiji, it's time to eat.

OSONO:        Kiki, how are you this morning?

KIKI:         I'm just fine;  Sorry I overslept.

OSONO:        That's all right.  When you come down, I have a favor
              to ask of you.

(In the bakery...)

KIKI:         The name is 'Kopori'?

OSONO:        Is this enough?

KIKI:         I don't want anything.  I can walk there, it's
              so close.

OSONO:        That won't do.  Business is business.  Be sure to hand
              it to the right person.

(In the courtyard...)

KIKI:         Jiji!

JIJI:         A job?

KIKI:         Well...a friend?  What's her name?

JIJI:         It's Lily.  I'll be right there.

KIKI:         That's OK, it's not far.  Miss Lily, I'll leave him in
              your care.

(On the terrace...)

KIKI:         How beautiful...

TOMBO:        Hey, Miss Witch!  Out for a walk?

KIKI:         No, I'm looking for someone named Kopori.

TOMBO:        ...That's me!

KIKI:         What?!

TOMBO:        Come around over there.   I'll be right down.

KIKI:         (looks at the slip)  It's Mrs. Osono!

(In front of Tombo's house...)

TOMBO:        Thank you.

KIKI:         Um, I'm sorry about the other day.  I kept you waiting
              for a long time.

TOMBO:        Uh-huh.  And how about you;  it must've been terrible
              in that rain.  Say, can you stop in for a minute?
              There's something I want to show you.  Hurry!

TOMBO:        It was a party to celebrate this.  It's part of a
              self-propelled flying machine.  Look.  The wings and
              fuselage are being made somewhere else.  We're going to
              fly it this summer vacation--I'm the pilot.

              Hey, do you want to go to the beach?   Let's go see
              the dirigible that stopped for repairs.

KIKI:         Dirigible?

TOMBO:        Didn't you see it on television?

KIKI:         I was in bed...

TOMBO:        Well then, let's go!

KIKI:         Are we going on this?

TOMBO:        Of course.  Training, training.  I have to strengthen
              my legs.  Okay, get on.

KIKI:         This is my first time on a bicycle.

TOMBO:        Really?  That's something.

TOMBO:        Hold us back with your feet, 'til we build up some
              forward pressure...Here we go...Kick-off!

KIKI:         Shall I get off?

TOMBO:        No-o-o...

(Barrelling down the street...)

PEOPLE IN
CAR:          Go for it!...Looking good!

TOMBO:        When we come to the sharp curve, lean over to the side.

KIKI:         What?!

TOMBO:        We can't turn unless we put our weight into it.
              (leans over)  Now!!  That's good, that's the way!!
              That was great!  Fantastic!

KIKI:         Is that what you call a 'dirigible'?

TOMBO:        Yeah.  (sees oncoming car)  Oh!!.....We're flying!!

(On the grass...)

KIKI:         Tombo, are you all right?

TOMBO:        Un...How about you?

KIKI:         I'm okay...(laughs hysterically)

TOMBO:        Is my face that funny?

KIKI:         ...That's not it...Sorry, but I was so scared...

TOMBO:        (laughs)  I was scared, too.  Hey, did you use your
              magic a little while ago?

KIKI:         I don't know; I was in a trance.  Oh, your bike is a
              wreck!

TOMBO:        Oh, no!  The gang'll be mad at me.  Kiki, keep an eye
              on it.

KIKI:         What's the matter?

TOMBO:        I've got cramps from pedaling!  Wait!...

(At the beach...)

TOMBO:        Isn't it great?  Wouldn't it be
              wonderful to circle the globe in one of those...
              Say, what was it like the first time you flew?

KIKI:         I don't remember, because I was very young, but my
              mother said I wasn't a bit scared.

TOMBO:        I wish I had been born in a witch's family.  You can
              fly with a broom, but I have to do it like this...
              (making pedaling motions)

KIKI:         But flying is part of my work.  It's not all fun and
              games.

TOMBO:        Is that so?  But it's work well-suited to your talents.
              That's great.

KIKI:         I'm glad I came here today, because I didn't feel
              confident.  When I see the ocean, I feel like I'm going
              to get better.

TOMBO:        I'll bring you anytime you like.  It'll be part of my
              training.

KIKI:         Tombo, you're nice, aren't you?

TOMBO:        Hey, you finally realized that?

KIKI:         Well, at first you seemed like a juvenile delinquent.

TOMBO:        That's what my mother always says, "This juvenile
              delinquent of a son...quit staring at the sky and start
              studying!!"

(A car comes by...Tombo's friends)

GIRL A:       Great news!

TOMBO:        What is it?

GIRL A:       Something great!  Hurry!

TOMBO:        Wait a minute!

GIRL B:       They'll let us see the inside of the dirigible.
              Want to go?

TOMBO:        Wow!  Neat!  I'm going, I'm going!

GIRL B:       Say, who's that girl?

TOMBO:        She's Kiki, the witch.  (to Kiki) Kiki, won't you come
              with us?  They'll show us the inside of the dirigible.

KIKI:         No, that's okay.

TOMBO:        Come on, let's go!

GIRL C:       I know her;  she's the delivery girl.

GIRL B:       Really?  She's already working?

GIRL A:       Ad-mi-ra-ble.

TOMBO:        Let's go.  I'll introduce you to everyone.

KIKI:         I'm not going.  Goodbye.

TOMBO:        What's wrong?  Why are you angry?

KIKI:         I'm not angry;  I have work to do. (leaves)
              Don't follow me.

GIRLS:        Tombo, we're going!
