(At the bakery...Sign:  "I deliver...Kiki")

KIKI:         How slow it is...

JIJI:         That won't do.  You're supposed to be watching the
              shop.

KIKI:         But there's not a single customer coming around.

JIJI:         It's going to be the busy hour pretty soon.

KIKI:         No, I mean customers for the delivery service.
              Jiji, if it's like this for a long, lo-o-o-ng time,
              and customers don't come, and every day, e-e-ev-ery
              day, until I become an old lady, we have only hot
              cakes to eat, what'll we do?

JIJI:         Myself, I like hotcakes...if they're not burned.

KIKI:         Huh.  Cats sure have an easy life.  Well, don't blame
              me if you get as big around as a hotcake...!

KIKI:         Isn't she pretty?  I hear she's a fashion designer.

JIJI:         I don't like her cat...'cause she's such a snob.

(The telephone rings...)

KIKI:         Hello, this is the Gutiokipanja bakery...Yes we do...
              (whispers)  Jiji, it's a customer, a customer!
              ...I should be at your house by 4:30.  Yes, I
              understand.  May I have your address?  Yes...yes...
              a house with a blue roof.  Thank you.  I'll be there
              without fail.

TOMBO:        This please.  Here you are.

KIKI:         Thank you very much.

TOMBO:        Listen, don't be mad, and hear me out.  Our club is
              having a party tonight.  It's called the Aviation Club,
              and we want you to come for sure.  Here's the
              invitation.

TOMBO:        It's a formal event.  Everyone's anxious to hear
              your story.

(A customer enters with a parcel...)

KIKI:         Ah, welcome.

CUSTOMER:     I heard you have a delivery service here .

KIKI:         Yes...Do you have a package to deliver?

CUSTOMER:     Can you deliver this right away?

KIKI:         Yes, I'll take care of it.

CUSTOMER:     Can you manage?

TOMBO:        Shall I help?

KIKI:         It's all right.

TOMBO:        (leaving)  I'll be here to pick you up at 6 o'clock,
              so decide by then, OK?  Bye!

CUSTOMER:     How much will it be?

KIKI:         Is it in-town or out-of-town?

CUSTOMER:     I wrote the address on the box.

KIKI:         Oh, I'm sorry.

(In the living room...)

KIKI:         Mrs. Osono!  What'll I do?!  I got an invitation to
              a party.

OSONO:        Isn't that nice.  You should go.

KIKI:         But I only have this one dress.

OSONO:        So, you're worried about that?  It's a very nice dress,
              because black shows off a girl's beauty.

KIKI:         Really?

OSONO:        How's the business?

KIKI:         I have two jobs.  It's already 4 o'clock!  Oh, no!
              I'm sorry, would you take over the shop?
              (running out) JIJI, JIJI!

(Over the town...)

JIJI:         You were so mad at that guy, and now you're going to
              his party?!

KIKI:         Don't talk now!  I have to concentrate;  this package
              is so heavy!

KIKI:         Thank you very much.
              (to Jiji)  We have to hurry!

(Airborne again...)

KIKI:         Next, we have an appointment at 4:30.  It's a blue roof.

(At an old mansion...)

KIKI:         Ah, I'm Kiki, the one who made an appointment for a
              pick-up.

BERTHA:       Yes, come in.  You're right on time, aren't you.

KIKI:         Yes.

BERTHA:       Madam, she's here.

MADAM:        Oh, no.  What a problem.  What to do?  Is it the
              appointed time already?

BERTHA:       (to Kiki)  Go on in.

KIKI:         All right.

BERTHA:       I'll take that for you.  A black cat and a
              broom.  It's just like my great-grandmother told me.

KIKI:         I'm Kiki, of the delivery service.

MADAM:        Well, well.  Such a cute witch.  But you know, the food
              I was going to have you deliver isn't ready yet.
              The oven temperature just won't go up.  Isn't it
              strange?

              It's no use, when machines and people get old.
              I thought I'd have you deliver a dish right out of
              the oven for my grandchild's party.  It's my specialty
              --herring and pumpkin pot pie.  But we'll have to give
              up.  I'll apologize to my grandchild on the phone.
              And you had to make a wasted trip, didn't you.

              BERTHA...BERTHA!  Give the witch her fee.

BERTHA:       Ah, yes?

MADAM:        That's all right.  Give her the amount we agreed on.

KIKI:         Madam!

MADAM:        Please accept it.  After all, it wasn't your fault.

KIKI:         Madam, I still have a little time.  Can't you use that
              oven?

MADAM:        Ah, that.  It used to bake beautifully, but I haven't
              used it for some time.

KIKI:         If it's a wood-burning oven, I can help.  In the
              country, my mother taught me how.

MADAM:        Even so, it's a lot of work.

BERTHA:       It's a great idea.  I don't like electric ovens, but if
              it's a wood-burning oven, we can use the fireplace logs.

KIKI:         Let's do it, Madam.

MADAM:        Should we?  Well then, can you help us?


(At the woodshed...)

JIJI:         Showing off is okay, but if you're late for the party,
              don't blame me.

KIKI:         But I couldn't just accept the money.  We have to hurry.

(In the kitchen...)

BERTHA:       (holding a bellows)  Look.  This still works.

MADAM:        You were well-trained by your mother, weren't you?
              You've got everything in good order.  It's sort of
              exciting, isn't it?

BERTHA:       I just hate electricity.

MADAM:        It looks like the right moment.  Ah, that's just right.
              Now all we do is wait.

KIKI:         About 40 minutes?

MADAM:        Yes, that's about right.  Well, let's take a little
              break.

KIKI:         Is there anything else I can help with?

MADAM:        Really?  Well, I wonder if we could impose on you?

JIJI:         This is asking too much.

KIKI:         Not at all.

JIJI:         I don't think you'll make it on time.  No way.

KIKI:         Worrywart!  If I fly full-speed, I can make it in
              exactly 15 minutes.

BERTHA:       The tea is ready.  Come this way.

(In the kitchen...)

MADAM:        ...!  A party at 6 o'clock?  Can you make it on time?

KIKI:         Sure, I can make it in 15 minutes.

MADAM:        Oh, no!!  That clock is 10 minutes slow!

KIKI:         Oh, what'll I do?

MADAM:        Hurry, the oven!

KIKI:         All right.

MADAM:        BERTHA, BERTHA!!

KIKI:         How does it look?

MADAM:        It looks fine.  Now, hurry!

KIKI:         All right.

BERTHA:       Hurry!

KIKI:         All right.

MADAM:        You forgot something.  (hands her some money)

KIKI:         ...No, this is too much!!

MADAM:        Please take it.

BERTHA:       Hurry, hurry!!

MADAM:        Have a nice time at the party.

BERTHA:       You can go out there!

(In the air...)

KIKI:         It was such beautiful weather until now.

JIJI:         My whiskers are crackling!

JIJI:         Let's get out of the rain!

KIKI:         We can't;  we'll be late, and this food will get cold!

(At the granddaughter's house...)

GRAND-DAUGHTER:     What do you want?

KIKI:         I have something to deliver.

GRAND-DAUGHTER:     Oh, it's soaking wet.

KIKI:         That's because it suddenly started to rain.  But the
              food is fine.

GRAND-DAUGHTER:     And I told her I didn't want it.

(from inside):What is it?

GRAND-DAUGHTER:     It's from Grandmother.  She sent a herring pie again.

KIKI:         Ah, would you sign for it, please?


GRAND-DAUGHTER:    You know, I hate this pie. 

JIJI:         Is she really that lady's granddaughter?  Beh...beh!!
              (sticks out tongue)

(Above the town...)

JIJI:         Is it too late for the party?  Kiki, there's that boy!
              You can still make it!
