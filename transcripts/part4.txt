(At the bakery...)

OSONO:       Kiki, you're just in time.  It's a customer.  There's
             someone here who needs something delivered.

KIKI:        Really?  I'll be right there!

(Running upstairs...)

KIKI:        Map...

(In the bakery...)

OSONO:        This is a regular customer of the shop.  When you came
              up in our conversation, she said it's just perfect.

MAKI:         What a cute witch!

KIKI:         My name is Kiki.

MAKI:         I'd like you to deliver this.  I wonder if it will get
              there by this evening?

KIKI:         Yes.

MAKI:         It's a birthday gift for my nephew.  Something came up
              at work and I can't make it to the party.

KIKI:         Where shall I deliver it?

JIJI:         (Sees the toy cat)   It's me!

MAKI:         I wonder if it's too far?

KIKI:         I can fly there in a straight line.

MAKI:         What about the fee?

KIKI:         Well, I haven't decided yet.

MAKI:         Do you think this would be enough?

KIKI:         It's so much.  Thank you!


(On the street...)

TOMBO:        (Watching Kiki ascend...)  Isn't that neat?!

OSONO:        If only I could fly, too...

TOMBO:        Lady, do you know that girl?!


(High above the town...)

JIJI:         Kiki, how high do you plan on flying?

KIKI:         Well, this is my first job--the police won't bother me
              up here.

JIJI:         (as a seaplane passes far below)  I thought you were
              making a delivery to an angel.

KIKI:         It's on the other side of that cape.  Here we go!

KIKI:         Jiji, I like this town.

JIJI:         It's too soon to make up your mind.

KIKI:         But now I can write a letter to Mother.

(Alongside the geese...)

KIKI:         A flock of geese!  How beautiful!  They're going in
              the same direction we are!

KIKI:         I wonder what's wrong?

JIJI:         They said a big wind is coming!

KIKI:         What?!

JIJI:         They're saying, 'Let's fly higher.'

(A gust of wind...)

KIKI:         (seeing the falling stuffed-cat)  Oh, no!!

(In the tree...)

KIKI:         This won't do!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry!  (seeing a nest)
              Please excuse me!  I wasn't going to steal your eggs!

KIKI:         Wow, that was scary!

JIJI:         Well, it was your fault.  After all, they warned you
              about the wind.

KIKI:         You're right.  Aren't they something?  Look how high
              they're flying, using that wind.

JIJI:         Kiki, it's gone!!

KIKI:         You're right!  Oh, no!!

JIJI:         It must have happened when we fell.

(The crows come back...)

JIJI:         They're saying, 'The egg-thief is back again'!

KIKI:         Oh, no.  What shall we do?!

KIKI:         Ohhh!...My broom.   Stop it!   Stop it!  (swinging the
              empty cage)  Hey, stop it!!

KIKI:         What a problem.  They're still kicking up a fuss...

JIJI:         Ah, a witch's standing has really fallen.  Crows used
              to be retainers to witches.

KIKI:         But that was a long time ago.
              The only thing we can do is wait until sunset and
              return quietly and search.

JIJI:         But then we'll be late for our delivery.

KIKI:         Jiji, we have to do this as a last resort.

JIJI:         This won't work!

KIKI:         Please.  I'll come and rescue you as soon as I find it.

(Above the cape...)

JIJI:         Is that the house?

KIKI:         Uh-huh.  Now don't move.

JIJI:         How about breathing?

KIKI:         As little as possible.

(At the house...)

KETTO:        It's Auntie's present!   How weird!  (laughs)

KETTO'S-MOTHER:      It took you a long time, didn't it?  My sister called,
              so we were expecting you.

KIKI:         I'm sorry.  Ah...Would you sign for it, please?

KETTO:        Mother, is it all right if I transfer the canary?

KETTO'S-MOTHER:      Yes, but be careful not to let it get away.


KETTO:        Okay.

KIKI:         Thank you very much.

(In the house...)

KETTO:        Now stay calm, Pitchi.  Hey, you're not getting away!

JIJI:         (whispering)  Kiki, hurry!


(In the forest...)

KIKI:         What am I going to do?  It should be around here
              somewhere.  There it is!

(At the cabin...)

KIKI:         Excuse me please!  Is anyone here?  Excuse me!

URSULA:       Yes...I can't stop now.  Would you come up here?

(On the roof...)

URSULA:       What is it?

KIKI:         That stuffed black cat in the window.  It's something I
              lost.

URSULA:       (to the crow)  You're a good birdie, aren't you.  Now,
              don't move.  (to Kiki)  I found it in the forest a
              little while ago.

KIKI:         May I have it back?

URSULA:       Just a minute;  I don't want to stop right now.
              (to the crow)  That's good.  Aren't you pretty.

(Back down at the cabin...)

URSULA:       Well, if that's the case, why didn't you say so
              earlier?  I just thought it was kind of cute.

KIKI:         Thank you!  Oh, it's ripped!

URSULA:       It's the crow's fault.  They were making a fuss at the
              time.

KIKI:         What shall I do?  It belongs to a customer.

URSULA:       How about a trade-off?

(Later, in the cabin...)

URSULA:       So, you're on your own at 13?  I think that's great--I
              like the idea!

KIKI:         Ah, can it be fixed?

URSULA:       I told you, leave it to me.

(The house on the cape...)

KETTO'S-MOTHER:      Ketto!  Ketto, hurry and take a bath!  The guests will
                 be here soon!  KET-TO!!

(The log cabin...)

URSULA:       Finished!

KIKI:         Thank you.

URSULA:       OK, hurry and go rescue Jiji.

KIKI:         But I haven't finished cleaning.

URSULA:       That's plenty.  Hurry, hurry!

KIKI:         Thank you.


(At the house on the cape...)

KETTO:        Jeff (the dog) is really a funny one.  (laughter)

KETTO'S-MOTHER:     It's so comical;  Jeff has taken such a liking to that
             stuffed cat, he won't let go of it.

GUEST A:      I wonder if he thinks it's a puppy?

GUEST B:      If Maki hears that, she'll be angry.  (laughter)

KETTO:        It's OK, I'm going to give it to Jeff.

KETTO'S-MOTHER:      Why don't you write a letter to Aunt Maki?


KETTO:        Okay.

GUEST A:      Jeff has really aged, hasn't he?  You have to be nice
              to him, Ketto.

KETTO:        But all he does is sleep.

GUEST A:      Isn't that the truth!

KETTO'S-MOTHER:      Ketto, Jeff wants to go out.  Open the door for him.


KETTO:        Okay.  When you're done, close the door yourself.

(Outside the house...)

KIKI:         JIJI!!

JIJI:         You're late!

KIKI:         I'm sorry.

JIJI:         (pointing to Jeff)  He's the one who saved me.  He
              says he'll replace the stuffed cat.

KIKI:         Can you do this favor for us?

(Above the town...)

KIKI:         Are you still feeling stiff?

JIJI:         I'm hungry.

KIKI:         That's right.  And I'm dead tired, too.  But it was a
              wonderful day.  And you know, the person who found the
              stuffed cat for me wants to paint a picture with me
              as a model.

JIJI:         Nude?

KIKI:         Stupid!
