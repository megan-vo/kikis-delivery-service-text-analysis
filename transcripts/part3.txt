(In front of a bakery...)

JIJI:         Let's find another town.  There's a bigger, better
              place somewhere else, I'm sure.

OSONO:        Ma'am!  You forgot something!  Ma'am!!

OSONO:        Oh, no, what a problem.  That baby will cry and cry
              without this.

OSONO:        I'm sorry, customers.  Please wait a minute, I have to
              deliver this.

KIKI:         Ah, would you like me to deliver it for you?

OSONO:        But...

KIKI:         It's that lady with the baby carriage who went around
              the corner, right?

OSONO:        Would you?    Thank you so much!

KIKI:         It's nothing.  Jiji, here we go.

OSONO:        Oh!...(she sees her flying)  Oho!...

(Kiki catches up with the lady and her carriage...)

KIKI:         The bakery lady asked me to deliver this.   Something
              you forgot.

(At the bakery...)

OSONO:        Thank you.  Sorry to keep you waiting.  The usual,
              right?

OSONO:        (to Kiki)  Ah, thank you for your trouble.  Come on
              in and wait a second.

              Thank you.  Sorry to keep you waiting.  Yes, thanks.
              Please take care.

OSONO:        (to Kiki)  That was quite a surprise.  So, you can fly!

KIKI:         I came to deliver this letter.

OSONO:        It's that lady's signature.   (Letter:  I have received
              the pacifier.  Thank you.)

KIKI:         Well, I'll be on my way.

OSONO:        Oh, wait.  Can't you stay a minute.  I want to thank
              you.  This way.

(In the kitchen...)

OSONO:        Sit down.  Is coffee OK?

KIKI:         Yes, thank you.

OSONO:        (to Jiji)  This is for you.

OSONO:        I see...So that's why you're looking for your own town.

KIKI:         The people of this town don't seem to like witches.

OSONO:        It's a big town, and there are all kinds of people.
              But me, I like you.   And, have you found a place to
              stay?

              Well, if that's the case, why didn't you say something
              earlier.  We have a spare room you can use.

KIKI:         Really, Madam?

OSONO:        (laughs)  Never mind the 'Madam'.  Here they all call
              me 'Osono of the bakery'.

KIKI:         I'm Kiki, and this black cat is Jiji.

(A dusty room upstairs...)

OSONO:        It's a little dusty, but you can fix it up to suit
              yourself.

KIKI:         Yes.

OSONO:        The water and toilet are downstairs.  If you need
              anything, don't hesitate to ask.

KIKI:         Thank you.

JIJI:         It's dusty with flour.

KIKI:         Right.

JIJI:         I think, by tomorrow, I'll be a white cat.

KIKI:         Jiji, we can see the ocean!

JIJI:         Tomorrow, shall we look for another town?

(Jiji looks at the cat next door...)

JIJI:         Huh!  Huh!  What a snob!

(Bedtime...)

KIKI:         I want to stay in this town a little longer.
              There may be others, like Madam Osono, who like me.

(The next morning...)

KIKI:         How much do you think it costs to have a phone put in?

JIJI:         A telephone?

KIKI:         Yes, I'm going to start a business.

(In the bakery...)

KIKI:         Good morning!

OSONO:        Morning!  Did you sleep well?

KIKI:         Uh-huh.  It smells good.  Is it all right if I help?

OSONO:        Um.

              So, a delivery service?

KIKI:         Since flying is the only skill I have, I thought,
              maybe, a delivery service.

OSONO:        That sounds interesting...a flying delivery service.
              You came up with a good idea!

              You can use that room.

KIKI:         Really?!  I'm so glad.  I'm thinking of having a
              phone put in.

OSONO:        Won't that be expensive?

KIKI:         I brought a little money with me.

OSONO:        That's wasteful.  Look, why don't you use the phone
              in the shop?  It'll be difficult until you have a
              regular clientele.  Since I'm in this condition, if
              you'll help mind the store occasionally, the room and
              the phone will be free.  And we'll throw in breakfast!

KIKI:         Oh, thank you!  I'll work very hard.  Madam Osono,
              you're a nice person, aren't you!

(Kiki cleans up her room...)

KIKI:         Jiji, I'm finished.  Let's go shopping.

(On the street...)

JIJI:         You shouldn't jump out into the street like that...
              After all, we're not out in the country.

KIKI:         I know, I know.  I did it without thinking.

GIRLS:        (laughter)   That's terrible...I wouldn't...But he.....

KIKI:         If only my clothes were a little nicer...

(Shopping...)

KIKI:         Just daily living takes a bit of money...

JIJI:         Kiki!!  Look, look!

(On the way home...)


JIJI:         Do you have enough money?

KIKI:         Well, we'll have to make do with hotcakes for awhile.

KIKI:         Aren't they beautiful?

TOMBO:        Stop!  Stop!
              Little-miss-witch, aren't you flying today?
              (to his friends)  See, didn't I tell you?  She's
              really wearing a black dress.  Hey, wait a minute,
              Miss Witch!...
