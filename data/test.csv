KIKI,Jiji! I've decided! I'm leaving tonight! ,6
KIKI,Mother!! Oh good day! Mother did you hear the weather forecast? It's going to clear tonight. There'll be a beautiful moon! ,21
KOKIRI,Kiki did you take Father's radio out again? ,8
KIKI,Well he won't mind. Mrs. Dora how are you? I've made up my mind I'm going to do it tonight. ,20
KOKIRI,But dear you said you were going to postpone it for a month... ,13
KIKI,But I don't know if the next full moon will be clear. I want to depart on a clear night. ,20
KOKIRI,Ah...Wait a minute! Kiki! ,4
DORA,Do witches have to leave home as part of their training? ,11
KOKIRI,Yes it's an old custom. If a child wants to be a witch she leaves home when she turns 13. ,20
DORA,How soon. So Kiki is at that age already? ,9
KOKIRI,But to leave home alone so young it won't do in this day and age. ,15
DORA,I remember well the day you came to this town. A tiny 13-year-old girl riding on a broom dropping out of the sky. Eyes sparkling a bit saucy... ,28
KOKIRI,But that child all she's mastered is flying. And there'll be no one to carry on my medicine-making. ,18
DORA,It's the fault of the times. Everything's changing. But for me and my rheumatism your medicine works the best. ,19
