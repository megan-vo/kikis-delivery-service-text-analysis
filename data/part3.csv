JIJI,Let's find another town. There's a bigger better place somewhere else I'm sure. ,13
OSONO,Ma'am! You forgot something! Ma'am!! ,5
OSONO,Oh no what a problem. That baby will cry and cry without this. ,13
OSONO,I'm sorry customers. Please wait a minute I have to deliver this. ,12
KIKI,Ah would you like me to deliver it for you? ,10
OSONO,But... ,1
KIKI,It's that lady with the baby carriage who went around the corner right? ,13
OSONO,Would you? Thank you so much! ,6
KIKI,It's nothing. Jiji here we go. ,6
OSONO,Oh!...(she sees her Oho!... ,4
KIKI,The bakery lady asked me to deliver this. Something you forgot. ,11
OSONO,Thank you. Sorry to keep you waiting. The usual right? ,10
OSONO,Ah thank you for your trouble. Come on in and wait a second. ,13
Thank,you. Sorry to keep you waiting. Yes thanks. Please take care. ,11
OSONO,That was quite a surprise. So you can fly! ,9
KIKI,I came to deliver this letter. ,6
OSONO,It's that lady's signature. ,4
KIKI,Well I'll be on my way. ,6
OSONO,Oh wait. Can't you stay a minute. I want to thank you. This way. ,14
OSONO,Sit down. Is coffee OK? ,5
KIKI,Yes thank you. ,3
OSONO,This is for you. ,4
OSONO,I see...So that's why you're looking for your own town. ,10
KIKI,The people of this town don't seem to like witches. ,10
OSONO,It's a big town and there are all kinds of people. But me I like you. And have you found a place to stay? ,24
Well,if that's the case why didn't you say something earlier. We have a spare room you can use. ,18
KIKI,Really Madam? ,2
OSONO,Never mind the 'Madam'. Here they all call me 'Osono of the bakery'. ,13
KIKI,I'm Kiki and this black cat is Jiji. ,8
OSONO,It's a little dusty but you can fix it up to suit yourself. ,13
KIKI,Yes. ,1
OSONO,The water and toilet are downstairs. If you need anything don't hesitate to ask. ,14
KIKI,Thank you. ,2
JIJI,It's dusty with flour. ,4
KIKI,Right. ,1
JIJI,I think by tomorrow I'll be a white cat. ,9
KIKI,Jiji we can see the ocean! ,6
JIJI,Tomorrow shall we look for another town? ,7
JIJI,Huh! Huh! What a snob! ,5
KIKI,I want to stay in this town a little longer. There may be others like Madam Osono who like me. ,20
KIKI,How much do you think it costs to have a phone put in? ,13
JIJI,A telephone? ,2
KIKI,Yes I'm going to start a business. ,7
KIKI,Good morning! ,2
OSONO,Morning! Did you sleep well? ,5
KIKI,Uh-huh. It smells good. Is it all right if I help? ,11
OSONO,Um. ,1
So,a delivery service? ,3
KIKI,Since flying is the only skill I have I thought maybe a delivery service. ,14
OSONO,That sounds interesting...a flying delivery service. You came up with a good idea! ,13
You,can use that room. ,4
KIKI,Really?! I'm so glad. I'm thinking of having a phone put in. ,12
OSONO,Won't that be expensive? ,4
KIKI,I brought a little money with me. ,7
OSONO,That's wasteful. Look why don't you use the phone in the shop? It'll be difficult until you have a regular clientele. Since I'm in this condition if you'll help mind the store occasionally the room and the phone will be free. And we'll throw in breakfast! ,46
KIKI,Oh thank you! I'll work very hard. Madam Osono you're a nice person aren't you! ,15
KIKI,Jiji I'm finished. Let's go shopping. ,6
JIJI,You shouldn't jump out into the street like that... After all we're not out in the country. ,17
KIKI,I know I know. I did it without thinking. ,9
GIRLS,That's terrible...I wouldn't...But he..... ,4
KIKI,If only my clothes were a little nicer... ,8
KIKI,Just daily living takes a bit of money... ,8
JIJI,Kiki!! Look look! ,3
JIJI,Do you have enough money? ,5
KIKI,Well we'll have to make do with hotcakes for awhile. ,10
KIKI,Aren't they beautiful? ,3
TOMBO,Stop! Stop! Little-miss-witch aren't you flying today? See didn't I tell you? She's really wearing a black dress. Hey wait a minute Miss Witch!... ,24
