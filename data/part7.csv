KIKI,......Jiji something's wrong with me. After finally making a friend I suddenly became spiteful. It seemed like the quiet and cheerful Kiki disappeared...(Jiji walks off)...? How cold hearted... ,28
KIKI,Jiji no matter how nice a friend you've met I wish you'd be on time for dinner. I can never finish cleaning up. ,23
JIJI,Meow... ,1
KIKI,What's with you talking like a cat? ,7
JIJI,Meow... ,1
KIKI,...Jiji what happened to your voice? Say 'Kiki' Jiji! Jiji! I wonder what happened? It seems that I can't understand Jiji...Oh no! ,22
KIKI,My magic has gotten weak. ,5
OSONO,You can't fly? Because your magic has disappeared? ,8
KIKI,It's gotten very weak. I'll have to cancel my delivery service. But then I'll help full-time at the shop. Please let me stay in that room. ,26
OSONO,Well that's no problem. Your magic powers will return won't they? ,11
KIKI,I don't know though I can make another broom. ,9
BAKER,Hey! ,1
TOMBO,Kiki? It's Tombo. Did you see me waving from the dirigible today? The captain let us go on a test flight. It was fantastic! Hello hello? Are you listening Kiki? ,30
KIKI,Don't call me anymore. ,4
TOMBO,Huh? What? I can't hear you. The captain wants to meet you. ...? Hello Hello?! ,15
OSONO,What's the matter Kiki? You're as white as a sheet. ,10
KIKI,I'm still in my training period. If my magic disappears there's nothing else I know how to do. ,18
URSULA,Kiki! Hi! Hey you didn't come to visit me at all so I came myself. ,15
KIKI,I'm sorry. ,2
URSULA,Well that's not true. I'm on a shopping trip so I stopped in. ,13
KIKI,Come on in. I'm between chores. ,6
URSULA,Of course. That's what I planned to do. ,8
URSULA,This is a pretty nice room. ,6
KIKI,Have some if you like. I'll make some tea. ,9
URSULA,No tea for me. Could I have milk if you have some? ,12
KIKI,Sure. ,1
URSULA,Aha it's true! Exactly like that stuffed cat! You're Jiji aren't you? How's the business? Are you on the right track? It's not going well? ,25
KIKI,I'm taking a little time off. ,6
URSULA,Oh? ,1
URSULA,On the street I thought you looked a little down-hearted. So that sort of thing happens to witches too? Look why don't you come and stay at my cabin? ,29
KIKI,What? ,1
URSULA,Excuse yourself with the shop-lady. One day won't hurt. Jiji won't you come too? Rather be with her huh? OK decide. Let's go right away. ,25
URSULA,It's here! ,2
URSULA,Made it. ,2
KIKI,How beautiful...! ,2
URSULA,What gives? Doesn't this beautiful girl catch anyone's eye? ,9
URSULA,What?! You thought I was a boy?? ,7
DRIVER,Well you looked like one. ,5
URSULA,And you didn't notice these beautiful legs? ,7
KIKI,The crows... ,2
URSULA,We've become good friends. Ya-hoo I'm home! ,7
KIKI,Good day. Please forgive me about last time. ,8
URSULA,Go on in. I'll get some water. ,7
URSULA,Well? ,1
KIKI,It's wonderful... ,2
URSULA,When I met you I got the inspiration to paint this picture. But you know I can't get this girl's face just right. I've been waiting for you to come. ,30
KIKI,Is this me? ,3
URSULA,Well I guess. Sit there a minute. Will you be my model? ,12
KIKI,But I'm not that beautiful. ,5
URSULA,You have a fine face. It's a lot nicer now than before. Now sit there. That chair is okay. Raise your head a little like you're looking off into the distance. That's it; hold it. ,35
Magic,and painting are a lot alike. You know a lot of times I just can't paint. ,16
KIKI,Really? When that happens what do you do? ,8
URSULA,No no. Don't look over here. ,6
KIKI,Before I could fly without giving it a thought. But now I don't know how I did it. ,18
URSULA,When that happens all one can do is struggle through it. I draw and draw and keep drawing. ,18
KIKI,But then if I can't fly... ,6
URSULA,Then I stop drawing. I take walks look at the scenery take naps do nothing. Then after a while all of a sudden I get the urge to draw again. ,30
KIKI,I wonder if that will happen? ,6
URSULA,It will. Hey look to the side. ,7
URSULA,I decided to become an artist when I was about your age. I liked to draw so much I almost hated to go to bed. And then one day all of a sudden I couldn't draw anything. Everything I drew I didn't like. ,43
KIKI,Hm... ,1
URSULA,I realized that my art up to then was a copy of someone else things I had seen somewhere. I decided I had to discover my own style. ,28
KIKI,Was it difficult? ,3
URSULA,It's still difficult. But then the results...They seem to be a little better than before. ,15
URSULA,Then witches don't go around casting spells? ,7
KIKI,No they say it's just something passed on to offspring. ,10
URSULA,It's nice to be a witch isn't it? I like the idea-- to be a witch to be an artist to be a baker...It's an energy bestowed by the gods or someone right? Though thanks to it we do have to suffer at times... ,44
KIKI,I never even thought about my magic powers. I used to think this training was just an old-fashioned custom...I was so happy you came today. If I were alone I'd just be running around in circles. ,36
URSULA,You know to tell you the truth I thought about destroying this painting many times. ,15
KIKI,Even though it's so beautiful? ,5
URSULA,When I met you today and saw your distressed face I thought 'That's it' and I was inspired. ,18
KIKI,Tease! ,1
URSULA,Now we're even. ,3
URSULA,OK I'm going to turn it off. ,7
KIKI,Um. I'm sorry I'm taking your bed. ,7
URSULA,That's OK. ,2
KIKI,Is it all right if I come and visit some time? ,11
URSULA,Sure. I'm here during the summer. And I'll go and visit you sometime too. ,14
KIKI,Right. ,1
