KIKI,How slow it is... ,4
JIJI,That won't do. You're supposed to be watching the shop. ,10
KIKI,But there's not a single customer coming around. ,8
JIJI,It's going to be the busy hour pretty soon. ,9
KIKI,No I mean customers for the delivery service. Jiji if it's like this for a long lo-o-o-ng time and customers don't come and every day e-e-ev-ery day until I become an old lady we have only hot cakes to eat what'll we do? ,43
JIJI,Myself I like hotcakes...if they're not burned. ,7
KIKI,Huh. Cats sure have an easy life. Well don't blame me if you get as big around as a hotcake...! ,20
KIKI,Isn't she pretty? I hear she's a fashion designer. ,9
JIJI,I don't like her cat...'cause she's such a snob. ,9
KIKI,Hello this is the Gutiokipanja bakery...Yes we do... Jiji it's a customer a customer! ...I should be at your house by 4:30. Yes I understand. May I have your address? Yes...yes... a house with a blue roof. Thank you. I'll be there without fail. ,44
TOMBO,This please. Here you are. ,5
KIKI,Thank you very much. ,4
TOMBO,Listen don't be mad and hear me out. Our club is having a party tonight. It's called the Aviation Club and we want you to come for sure. Here's the invitation. ,31
TOMBO,It's a formal event. Everyone's anxious to hear your story. ,10
KIKI,Ah welcome. ,2
CUSTOMER,I heard you have a delivery service here . ,9
KIKI,Yes...Do you have a package to deliver? ,7
CUSTOMER,Can you deliver this right away? ,6
KIKI,Yes I'll take care of it. ,6
CUSTOMER,Can you manage? ,3
TOMBO,Shall I help? ,3
KIKI,It's all right. ,3
TOMBO,I'll be here to pick you up at 6 o'clock so decide by then OK? Bye! ,16
CUSTOMER,How much will it be? ,5
KIKI,Is it in-town or out-of-town? ,5
CUSTOMER,I wrote the address on the box. ,7
KIKI,Oh I'm sorry. ,3
KIKI,Mrs. Osono! What'll I do?! I got an invitation to a party. ,12
OSONO,Isn't that nice. You should go. ,6
KIKI,But I only have this one dress. ,7
OSONO,So you're worried about that? It's a very nice dress because black shows off a girl's beauty. ,17
KIKI,Really? ,1
OSONO,How's the business? ,3
KIKI,I have two jobs. It's already 4 o'clock! Oh no! I'm sorry would you take over the shop? JIJI JIJI! ,20
JIJI,You were so mad at that guy and now you're going to his party?! ,14
KIKI,Don't talk now! I have to concentrate; this package is so heavy! ,12
KIKI,Thank you very much. We have to hurry! ,8
KIKI,Next we have an appointment at 4:30. It's a blue roof. ,11
KIKI,Ah I'm Kiki the one who made an appointment for a pick-up. ,12
BERTHA,Yes come in. You're right on time aren't you. ,9
KIKI,Yes. ,1
BERTHA,Madam she's here. ,3
MADAM,Oh no. What a problem. What to do? Is it the appointed time already? ,14
BERTHA,Go on in. ,3
KIKI,All right. ,2
BERTHA,I'll take that for you. A black cat and a broom. It's just like my great-grandmother told me. ,18
KIKI,I'm Kiki of the delivery service. ,6
MADAM,Well well. Such a cute witch. But you know the food I was going to have you deliver isn't ready yet. The oven temperature just won't go up. Isn't it strange? ,31
MADAM,It's no use when machines and people get old. I thought I'd have you deliver a dish right out of the oven for my grandchild's party. It's my specialty --herring and pumpkin pot pie. But we'll have to give up. I'll apologize to my grandchild on the phone. And you had to make a wasted trip didn't you. ,57
MADAM,BERTHA...BERTHA! Give the witch her fee. ,5
BERTHA,Ah yes? ,2
MADAM,That's all right. Give her the amount we agreed on. ,10
KIKI,Madam! ,1
MADAM,Please accept it. After all it wasn't your fault. ,9
KIKI,Madam I still have a little time. Can't you use that oven? ,12
MADAM,Ah that. It used to bake beautifully but I haven't used it for some time. ,15
KIKI,If it's a wood-burning oven I can help. In the country my mother taught me how. ,16
MADAM,Even so it's a lot of work. ,7
BERTHA,It's a great idea. I don't like electric ovens but if it's a wood-burning oven we can use the fireplace logs. ,21
KIKI,Let's do it Madam. ,4
MADAM,Should we? Well then can you help us? ,8
JIJI,Showing off is okay but if you're late for the party don't blame me. ,14
KIKI,But I couldn't just accept the money. We have to hurry. ,11
BERTHA,Look. This still works. ,4
MADAM,You were well-trained by your mother weren't you? You've got everything in good order. It's sort of exciting isn't it? ,20
BERTHA,I just hate electricity. ,4
MADAM,It looks like the right moment. Ah that's just right. Now all we do is wait. ,16
KIKI,About 40 minutes? ,3
MADAM,Yes that's about right. Well let's take a little break. ,10
KIKI,Is there anything else I can help with? ,8
MADAM,Really? Well I wonder if we could impose on you? ,10
JIJI,This is asking too much. ,5
KIKI,Not at all. ,3
JIJI,I don't think you'll make it on time. No way. ,10
KIKI,Worrywart! If I fly full-speed I can make it in exactly 15 minutes. ,13
BERTHA,The tea is ready. Come this way. ,7
MADAM,...! A party at 6 o'clock? Can you make it on time? ,12
KIKI,Sure I can make it in 15 minutes. ,8
MADAM,Oh no!! That clock is 10 minutes slow! ,8
KIKI,Oh what'll I do? ,4
MADAM,Hurry the oven! ,3
KIKI,All right. ,2
MADAM,BERTHA BERTHA!! ,2
KIKI,How does it look? ,4
MADAM,It looks fine. Now hurry! ,5
KIKI,All right. ,2
BERTHA,Hurry! ,1
KIKI,All right. ,2
MADAM,You forgot something. ,3
KIKI,...No this is too much!! ,5
MADAM,Please take it. ,3
BERTHA,Hurry hurry!! ,2
MADAM,Have a nice time at the party. ,7
BERTHA,You can go out there! ,5
KIKI,It was such beautiful weather until now. ,7
JIJI,My whiskers are crackling! ,4
JIJI,Let's get out of the rain! ,6
KIKI,We can't; we'll be late and this food will get cold! ,11
GRAND-DAUGHTER,What do you want? ,4
KIKI,I have something to deliver. ,5
GRAND-DAUGHTER,Oh it's soaking wet. ,4
KIKI,That's because it suddenly started to rain. But the food is fine. ,12
GRAND-DAUGHTER,And I told her I didn't want it. ,8
GRAND-DAUGHTER,It's from Grandmother. She sent a herring pie again. ,9
KIKI,Ah would you sign for it please? ,7
GRAND-DAUGHTER,You know I hate this pie. ,6
JIJI,Is she really that lady's granddaughter? Beh...beh!! ,7
JIJI,Is it too late for the party? Kiki there's that boy! You can still make it! ,16
