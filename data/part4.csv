OSONO,Kiki you're just in time. It's a customer. There's someone here who needs something delivered. ,15
KIKI,Really? I'll be right there! ,5
KIKI,Map... ,1
OSONO,This is a regular customer of the shop. When you came up in our conversation she said it's just perfect. ,20
MAKI,What a cute witch! ,4
KIKI,My name is Kiki. ,4
MAKI,I'd like you to deliver this. I wonder if it will get there by this evening? ,16
KIKI,Yes. ,1
MAKI,It's a birthday gift for my nephew. Something came up at work and I can't make it to the party. ,20
KIKI,Where shall I deliver it? ,5
JIJI,It's me! ,2
MAKI,I wonder if it's too far? ,6
KIKI,I can fly there in a straight line. ,8
MAKI,What about the fee? ,4
KIKI,Well I haven't decided yet. ,5
MAKI,Do you think this would be enough? ,7
KIKI,It's so much. Thank you! ,5
TOMBO,Isn't that neat?! ,3
OSONO,If only I could fly too... ,6
TOMBO,Lady do you know that girl?! ,6
JIJI,Kiki how high do you plan on flying? ,8
KIKI,Well this is my first job--the police won't bother me up here. ,12
JIJI,I thought you were making a delivery to an angel. ,10
KIKI,It's on the other side of that cape. Here we go! ,11
KIKI,Jiji I like this town. ,5
JIJI,It's too soon to make up your mind. ,8
KIKI,But now I can write a letter to Mother. ,9
KIKI,A flock of geese! How beautiful! They're going in the same direction we are! ,14
KIKI,I wonder what's wrong? ,4
JIJI,They said a big wind is coming! ,7
KIKI,What?! ,1
JIJI,They're saying 'Let's fly higher.' ,5
KIKI,Oh no!! ,2
KIKI,This won't do! I'm sorry I'm sorry! Please excuse me! I wasn't going to steal your eggs! ,17
KIKI,Wow that was scary! ,4
JIJI,Well it was your fault. After all they warned you about the wind. ,13
KIKI,You're right. Aren't they something? Look how high they're flying using that wind. ,13
JIJI,Kiki it's gone!! ,3
KIKI,You're right! Oh no!! ,4
JIJI,It must have happened when we fell. ,7
JIJI,They're saying 'The egg-thief is back again'! ,7
KIKI,Oh no. What shall we do?! ,6
KIKI,Ohhh!...My broom. Stop it! Stop it! Hey stop it!! ,9
KIKI,What a problem. They're still kicking up a fuss... ,9
JIJI,Ah a witch's standing has really fallen. Crows used to be retainers to witches. ,14
KIKI,But that was a long time ago. The only thing we can do is wait until sunset and return quietly and search. ,22
JIJI,But then we'll be late for our delivery. ,8
KIKI,Jiji we have to do this as a last resort. ,10
JIJI,This won't work! ,3
KIKI,Please. I'll come and rescue you as soon as I find it. ,12
JIJI,Is that the house? ,4
KIKI,Uh-huh. Now don't move. ,4
JIJI,How about breathing? ,3
KIKI,As little as possible. ,4
KETTO,It's Auntie's present! How weird! ,5
KETTO'S,It took you a long time didn't it? My sister called MOTHER so we were expecting you. ,17
KIKI,I'm sorry. Ah...Would you sign for it please? ,8
KETTO,Mother is it all right if I transfer the canary? ,10
KETTO'S,Yes but be careful not to let it get away. MOTHER ,11
KETTO,Okay. ,1
KIKI,Thank you very much. ,4
KETTO,Now stay calm Pitchi. Hey you're not getting away! ,9
JIJI,Kiki hurry! ,2
KIKI,What am I going to do? It should be around here somewhere. There it is! ,15
KIKI,Excuse me please! Is anyone here? Excuse me! ,8
URSULA,Yes...I can't stop now. Would you come up here? ,9
URSULA,What is it? ,3
KIKI,That stuffed black cat in the window. It's something I lost. ,11
URSULA,You're a good birdie aren't you. Now don't move. I found it in the forest a little while ago. ,19
KIKI,May I have it back? ,5
URSULA,Just a minute; I don't want to stop right now. That's good. Aren't you pretty. ,15
URSULA,Well if that's the case why didn't you say so earlier? I just thought it was kind of cute. ,19
KIKI,Thank you! Oh it's ripped! ,5
URSULA,It's the crow's fault. They were making a fuss at the time. ,12
KIKI,What shall I do? It belongs to a customer. ,9
URSULA,How about a trade-off? ,4
URSULA,So you're on your own at 13? I think that's great--I like the idea! ,14
KIKI,Ah can it be fixed? ,5
URSULA,I told you leave it to me. ,7
KETTO'S,Ketto! Ketto hurry and take a bath! The guests will MOTHER be here soon! KET-TO!! ,15
URSULA,Finished! ,1
KIKI,Thank you. ,2
URSULA,OK hurry and go rescue Jiji. ,6
KIKI,But I haven't finished cleaning. ,5
URSULA,That's plenty. Hurry hurry! ,4
KIKI,Thank you. ,2
KETTO,Jeff is really a funny one. ,6
KETTO'S,: It's so comical; Jeff has taken such a liking to that MOTHER stuffed cat he won't let go of it. ,21
GUEST,A: I wonder if he thinks it's a puppy? ,9
GUEST,B: If Maki hears that she'll be angry. ,8
KETTO,It's OK I'm going to give it to Jeff. ,9
KETTO'S,Why don't you write a letter to Aunt Maki? MOTHER ,10
KETTO,Okay. ,1
GUEST,A: Jeff has really aged hasn't he? You have to be nice to him Ketto. ,15
KETTO,But all he does is sleep. ,6
GUEST,A: Isn't that the truth! ,5
KETTO'S,Ketto Jeff wants to go out. Open the door for him. MOTHER ,12
KETTO,Okay. When you're done close the door yourself. ,8
KIKI,JIJI!! ,1
JIJI,You're late! ,2
KIKI,I'm sorry. ,2
JIJI,He's the one who saved me. He says he'll replace the stuffed cat. ,13
KIKI,Can you do this favor for us? ,7
KIKI,Are you still feeling stiff? ,5
JIJI,I'm hungry. ,2
KIKI,That's right. And I'm dead tired too. But it was a wonderful day. And you know the person who found the stuffed cat for me wants to paint a picture with me as a model. ,35
JIJI,Nude? ,1
KIKI,Stupid! ,1
