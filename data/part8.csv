TV,The dirigible 'Spirit of Freedom' that landed in this town due to the heavy rainstorm has finished its repairs and will continue its journey to the South Pole. We plan to broadcast the departure live from the seaside park. ,39
OSONO,Yes this is the Gutiokipanja bakery. Oh Kiki. Yes. But you should take more time...Oh yes. The lady you met the other day wants you to stop over again. What do you want to do? Shall I turn her down? I told her you were on vacation for awhile but she insists...Really? Then stop in on your way back. Bye. ,60
KIKI,Good day. ,2
BERTHA,Well well come in. We've been waiting eagerly. ,8
TV,It's almost 5 minutes until departure. The city's 'Seahorse Band' is playing and the crew is waving to the crowd below. The group of people holding the rope are eagerly awaiting the departure signal. The final check seems almost complete... ,40
KIKI,Here I am Madam. ,4
MADAM,Welcome. Please excuse me for not getting up. The weather's nice but my legs are bothering me. Bertha would you bring it? ,22
BERTHA,Yes yes. Madam has it taken off yet? ,8
MADAM,Not yet. Isn't it funny? She's crazy about dirigibles. ,9
BERTHA,It's the adventure that I like. ,6
MADAM,Would you turn the sound down a bit? Kiki would you open this box? ,14
KIKI,All right. Madam this... ,4
MADAM,I'd like that delivered to a person named Kiki because she did a big favor for me the other day. It's my way of saying 'Thank you'. I'd also be happy if at the same time you would find out her birthday. Then I can bake another cake... Kiki... ,49
KIKI,I'm very sure that person will want to know Madam's birthday too. It would be fun thinking of a present. ,20
MADAM,That's true isn't it. ,4
KIKI,,0
TV,It's a gust of wind. A gale...Oh! ,7
MADAM,What happened? ,2
BERTHA,It seems like there was an accident. ,7
TV,It's serious trouble! The rope has broken!! The dirigible is being blown away. Ah it's coming towards our broadcast truck! Oh no!! ,22
BERTHA,Ah at the most important moment...what are they showing!? ,9
MADAM,These strong winds sometimes come up in the summer. It will come by here in a minute. ,17
BERTHA,Madam! The picture's back. It's upside down!! ,7
TV,We're here at the seaside park...Blown by a sudden gust of wind the 'Spirit of Freedom' is almost touching ground... ,20
BERTHA,When you come right down to it it's just a balloon. ,11
TV,It's lost its balance and the ship is now upside down. They're doing their best to anchor the last rope holding the dirigible. I wonder if they can hold the ship; it looks like it's ready to float away. Ahh it's no good... ,43
The,tremendous lift of the helium gas is pulling the dirigible higher and higher. The powerful force of the helium matched against several hundred people... ,24
KIKI,Tombo!! That boy's a friend of mine! ,7
TV,It's throwing off people one by one and floating higher and higher. Ah even a patrol car is being carried away like a toy. What's going to happen...?! ,28
A,young boy is being carried away with a patrol car! This is terrible! Who would have thought something like this would happen?! ,22
KIKI,Tombo! ,1
MADAM,You say he's a friend of yours? ,7
KIKI,I have to go. ,4
MADAM,Be careful! ,2
BERTHA,How terrible! ,2
CAPTAIN,Hold on! Don't let go! Release helium from the rear compartments! Hurry!! ,12
RADIO,The helium in the dirigible will not explode. Townspeople don't panic and move about calmly. ,15
KIKI,How's Tombo?...Is the boy all right?! ,6
MAN,IN CAR: I don't know but they said the patrol car fell. ,12
FIRETRUCK,Move aside! Open up the street! Clear the way! ,9

BYSTANDER,She's flying...! ,2
KIKI,Fly straight or I'll throw you in the fire! ,9
ANNOUNCER,Nothing has happened to the boy yet but the 'Spirit of Freedom' is being blown by the wind and is approaching the city tower. If it continues it'll crash into the tower... ,32
TOMBO,We're going to hit! More altitude! ,6
CAPTAIN,We don't have enough gas! Before we crash jump into the tower! ,12
TOMBO,I'll try! ,2
CARETAKER,Hey! Come over here! ,4

CARETAKER,Grab this! ,2
KIKI,Fly faster! Hey!! ,3
ANNOUNCER,Listen to that! It's the tremendous noise of the gas escaping. We can't see from here what happened to the young lad. ,22
It's,going to fall! The gas is escaping! The dirigible is going to fall!! It's caught! It stopped! It's been stopped! Look the lad is still there! It's a miracle! The lad is still hanging there! But then how are they going to save him? If they don't do something that brave lad... ,52
ANNOUNCER,What what was that?! A bird...No it's a young girl! A young girl is flying through the air!! It's a witch! It's not a broom! It's a witch riding on a push broom!! ,33
