CARETAKER,Hey a witch! Isn't that something! ,6
KIKI,Good morning. Is there a witch in this town? ,9
CARETAKER,Hmm...I haven't seen one for a long time. ,8
KIKI,Did you hear that? I've decided on this town. Thanks mister! ,11
CARETAKER,Not at all!... ,3
JIJI,You really want to go down there? ,7
KIKI,Of course! ,2
JIJI,They're all looking. ,3
KIKI,Smile. We have to make a good first impression. ,9
KIKI,Ahem...I'm Kiki a witch and this black cat is Jiji. I hope I'm not intruding. I'd like to live in this town. It's beautiful and the clock tower is wonderful. ,30
WOMAN-BYSTANDER,Really? I'm so glad you like it here. ,8
COP,Hey you! You can't jump out in the street like that! You almost caused a big accident! Flying around town like that is dangerous. ,24
KIKI,But I'm a witch. All witches fly. ,7
COP,Witches have to obey the traffic laws like everyone else. Your name and address? ,14
KIKI,You're going to notify my home? ,6
COP,You're a minor aren't you. I will if I have to. ,11
COP,You wait right here! ,4
JIJI,Kiki... ,1
TOMBO,Hey there...That worked out great didn't it? I'm the one who yelled out 'Thief!' You're a witch aren't you? I saw you flying. ,23
So,you really do fly on a broom. Say will you let me see it? ,14
BOYS,Tombo! Hunting girls so early in the morning? ,8
TOMBO,Idiots! Oops... ,2
TOMBO,Hey please for just a minute OK? ,7
KIKI,Thank you for saving me. But I didn't ask for your help. And when you haven't been properly introduced it's rude to start talking to a girl. Hmph! ,28
TOMBO,You're really a witch aren't you...just like my grandmother. ,9
KIKI,Don't follow me! ,3
TOMBO,Ah...Cool! ,1
HOTEL-CLERK,A room? Is there a guardian with you? ,8
KIKI,I'm a witch. Witches become independent when they turn 13. ,10
HOTEL-CLERK,Well then may I see some identification? ,7
KIKI,Never mind. ,2
JIJI,Aren't you going to eat? ,5
KIKI,If you want it you can have it. ,8
JIJI,It'll be evening soon. ,4
KIKI,Let's go. ,2
