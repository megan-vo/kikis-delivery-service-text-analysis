OSONO,That was quite a downpour. That boy waited a long time. ,11
KIKI,It's too late now. I can't go like this anyway. ,10
JIJI,What's the matter Kiki? Have a headache? Let's eat I'm hungry. ,11
OSONO,KIKI! ,1
OSONO,Are you feeling sick?...What a fever! ,6
KIKI,My head's throbbing. ,3
OSONO,Last night you didn't dry off completely did you? ,9
KIKI,I think I'm going to die... ,6
OSONO,It's just a cold. I'll bring you some medicine. And also you'll have to eat something. ,16
KIKI,I'm not hungry. ,3
OSONO,It's better to eat a little even if you don't want to. I'll make you some milk-gruel. Some for Jiji too. ,21
OSONO,This is best when one has a cold. Here Jiji. It's hot so be careful. Now eat some while it's hot. Can you get up? ,25
KIKI,Do I absolutely have to? ,5
OSONO,Well if you want to get healthy again. Oh yes. That boy came to the shop a little while ago. When I told him you were sick he said 'You mean witches get sick too?' He wants to visit you later. What do you want to do? ,47
KIKI,No no! ,2
OSONO,I thought you'd say that so I turned him down politely. You have a good rest; you overtaxed yourself. I'll open the window OK? ,24
KIKI,Mrs. Osono?...Oh nothing. ,3
KIKI,JIJI...JIJI!! ,1
JIJI,What? ,1
KIKI,Jiji it's time to eat. ,5
OSONO,Kiki how are you this morning? ,6
KIKI,I'm just fine; Sorry I overslept. ,6
OSONO,That's all right. When you come down I have a favor to ask of you. ,15
KIKI,The name is 'Kopori'? ,4
OSONO,Is this enough? ,3
KIKI,I don't want anything. I can walk there it's so close. ,11
OSONO,That won't do. Business is business. Be sure to hand it to the right person. ,15
KIKI,Jiji! ,1
JIJI,A job? ,2
KIKI,Well...a friend? What's her name? ,5
JIJI,It's Lily. I'll be right there. ,6
KIKI,That's OK it's not far. Miss Lily I'll leave him in your care. ,13
KIKI,How beautiful... ,2
TOMBO,Hey Miss Witch! Out for a walk? ,7
KIKI,No I'm looking for someone named Kopori. ,7
TOMBO,...That's me! ,2
KIKI,What?! ,1
TOMBO,Come around over there. I'll be right down. ,8
KIKI,It's Mrs. Osono! ,3
TOMBO,Thank you. ,2
KIKI,Um I'm sorry about the other day. I kept you waiting for a long time. ,15
TOMBO,Uh-huh. And how about you; it must've been terrible in that rain. Say can you stop in for a minute? There's something I want to show you. Hurry! ,28
TOMBO,It was a party to celebrate this. It's part of a self-propelled flying machine. Look. The wings and fuselage are being made somewhere else. We're going to fly it this summer vacation--I'm the pilot. ,34
Hey,do you want to go to the beach? Let's go see the dirigible that stopped for repairs. ,17
KIKI,Dirigible? ,1
TOMBO,Didn't you see it on television? ,6
KIKI,I was in bed... ,4
TOMBO,Well then let's go! ,4
KIKI,Are we going on this? ,5
TOMBO,Of course. Training training. I have to strengthen my legs. Okay get on. ,13
KIKI,This is my first time on a bicycle. ,8
TOMBO,Really? That's something. ,3
TOMBO,Hold us back with your feet 'til we build up some forward pressure...Here we go...Kick-off! ,15
KIKI,Shall I get off? ,4
TOMBO,No-o-o... ,1
PEOPLE,IN CAR: Go for it!...Looking good! ,6
TOMBO,When we come to the sharp curve lean over to the side. ,12
KIKI,What?! ,1
TOMBO,We can't turn unless we put our weight into it. Now!! That's good that's the way!! That was great! Fantastic! ,20
KIKI,Is that what you call a 'dirigible'? ,7
TOMBO,Yeah. Oh!!.....We're flying!! ,3
KIKI,Tombo are you all right? ,5
TOMBO,Un...How about you? ,3
KIKI,I'm okay...(laughs ,2
TOMBO,Is my face that funny? ,5
KIKI,...That's not it...Sorry but I was so scared... ,8
TOMBO,I was scared too. Hey did you use your magic a little while ago? ,14
KIKI,I don't know; I was in a trance. Oh your bike is a wreck! ,14
TOMBO,Oh no! The gang'll be mad at me. Kiki keep an eye on it. ,14
KIKI,What's the matter? ,3
TOMBO,I've got cramps from pedaling! Wait!... ,6
TOMBO,Isn't it great? Wouldn't it be wonderful to circle the globe in one of those... Say what was it like the first time you flew? ,25
KIKI,I don't remember because I was very young but my mother said I wasn't a bit scared. ,17
TOMBO,I wish I had been born in a witch's family. You can fly with a broom but I have to do it like this... ,24
KIKI,But flying is part of my work. It's not all fun and games. ,13
TOMBO,Is that so? But it's work well-suited to your talents. That's great. ,12
KIKI,I'm glad I came here today because I didn't feel confident. When I see the ocean I feel like I'm going to get better. ,24
TOMBO,I'll bring you anytime you like. It'll be part of my training. ,12
KIKI,Tombo you're nice aren't you? ,5
TOMBO,Hey you finally realized that? ,5
KIKI,Well at first you seemed like a juvenile delinquent. ,9
TOMBO,That's what my mother always says 'This juvenile delinquent of a son...quit staring at the sky and start studying!!' ,19
GIRL,A: Great news! ,3
TOMBO,What is it? ,3
GIRL,A: Something great! Hurry! ,4
TOMBO,Wait a minute! ,3
GIRL,B: They'll let us see the inside of the dirigible. Want to go? ,13
TOMBO,Wow! Neat! I'm going I'm going! ,6
GIRL,B: Say who's that girl? ,5
TOMBO,She's Kiki the witch. Kiki won't you come with us? They'll show us the inside of the dirigible. ,18
KIKI,No that's okay. ,3
TOMBO,Come on let's go! ,4
GIRL,C: I know her; she's the delivery girl. ,8
GIRL,B: Really? She's already working? ,5
GIRL,A: Ad-mi-ra-ble. ,2
TOMBO,Let's go. I'll introduce you to everyone. ,7
KIKI,I'm not going. Goodbye. ,4
TOMBO,What's wrong? Why are you angry? ,6
KIKI,I'm not angry; I have work to do. Don't follow me. ,11
GIRLS,Tombo we're going! ,3
