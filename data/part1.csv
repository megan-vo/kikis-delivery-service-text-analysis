RADIO,...Now for the weather report from Northwest Karikiya. A high pressure system over land will bring good weather overall. Tonight the wind will be from the west by northwest wind pressure 3 clear with a beautiful full moon. Tomorrow should be clear and also the day after. Next the futures prices from the Karikiya Central Produce Market... ,57
KIKI,Jiji! I've decided! I'm leaving tonight! ,6
KIKI,Mother!! Oh good day! Mother did you hear the weather forecast? It's going to clear tonight. There'll be a beautiful moon! ,21
KOKIRI,Kiki did you take Father's radio out again? ,8
KIKI,Well he won't mind. Mrs. Dora how are you? I've made up my mind I'm going to do it tonight. ,20
KOKIRI,But dear you said you were going to postpone it for a month... ,13
KIKI,But I don't know if the next full moon will be clear. I want to depart on a clear night. ,20
KOKIRI,Ah...Wait a minute! Kiki! ,4
DORA,Do witches have to leave home as part of their training? ,11
KOKIRI,Yes it's an old custom. If a child wants to be a witch she leaves home when she turns 13. ,20
DORA,How soon. So Kiki is at that age already? ,9
KOKIRI,But to leave home alone so young it won't do in this day and age. ,15
DORA,I remember well the day you came to this town. A tiny 13-year-old girl riding on a broom dropping out of the sky. Eyes sparkling a bit saucy... ,28
KOKIRI,But that child all she's mastered is flying. And there'll be no one to carry on my medicine-making. ,18
DORA,It's the fault of the times. Everything's changing. But for me and my rheumatism your medicine works the best. ,19
KIKI,Well you were so eager to depart and now that the time has come you're sure dilly-dallying. ,17
JIJI,No it's not that. After all it's the beginning of your independence and you should be more cautious and calm. ,20
KIKI,So what'll I do if I wait a month and in the meantime find a nice boyfriend? It'll be too hard to leave then. ,24
JIJI,It's always a worry what'll happen because once you decide you're such an impulsive person. ,15
KIKI,Well I guess I am. I'm all excited like when I'm about to open up a gift. ,17
KIKI,Father I've decided to leave tonight. ,6
OKINO,What did you say?? ,4
KIKI,I decided just a little while ago. ,7
OKINO,But look I borrowed the camping equipment for next week... ,10
KIKI,I'm sorry. ,2
OKINO,This won't do! Ah...Ah! ,4
This,is Okino. Kiki's leaving tonight... Yes that's right. ,8
KOKIRI,It looks nice doesn't it? ,5
KIKI,If only it were purple... ,5
KOKIRI,Witches have worn that since long ago. ,7
KIKI,A black cat black clothes...I'm all in black. ,8
KOKIRI,Kiki don't worry so much about your appearance. What's important is the 'inner soul'. ,14
KIKI,Yes I understand. Leave the 'inner soul' part to me. It's too bad I can't show it to you. ,19
KOKIRI,And don't forget to always smile. ,6
KIKI,O-kay! ,1
KOKIRI,And write us a letter as soon as you're settled. ,10
KIKI,Father! May I have that radio? All right? The radio?! Hooray!! ,11
OKINO,,0
KIKI,Father lift me up 'high-high' like when I was small. ,10
OKINO,All right. When did you get so big?... If it doesn't go well you can always return home. ,18
KIKI,That's not going to happen. ,5
OKINO,It'll be nice if you find a nice town. ,9
KIKI,Right. ,1
NEIGHBOR,A: That's hard--to find a town to live in by yourself. ,11
NEIGHBOR,B: Kiki will do fine. ,5
FRIEND,A: What kind of town will you choose? ,8
FRIEND,B: A big city? ,4
KIKI,Well I'm planning to find a town overlooking the ocean. ,10
FRIENDS,Oh how wonderful. We're jealous! ,5
KIKI,But I'm going for my training. I can't become a witch unless I live for one year in another town. ,20
FRIEND,C: But there'll be a disco there won't there? ,9
KOKIRI,Kiki it's time. ,3
KIKI,All right. ,2
KOKIRI,Dear are you going with that broom? ,7
KIKI,Yes I just made it. Isn't it cute? ,8
KOKIRI,It won't do; it's so small. Take Mother's broom. ,9
KIKI,Oh no! It's so old. ,5
KOKIRI,That's why it's just right. It's been through a lot and will weather any storm. Take it OK? ,18
KIKI,But I worked so hard to make this one. Right Jiji? ,11
JIJI,I think your mother's broom is better... ,7
KIKI,Backstabber! ,1
DORA,Kiki when you get settled in your new town you can make your own can't you? ,16
OKINO,Be careful. ,2
KOKIRI,Chin up. ,2
KIKI,I'll be off. ,3
KOKIRI,Do your best! Take it easy! Be sure to write! ,10
FRIENDS,Go go Kiki! Go go Kiki! Go go Kiki...! ,9
KOKIRI,Oh clumsy as always! ,4
OKINO,It's OK. I think she's off without any trouble. ,9
NEIGHBOR,I guess we won't be hearing those bells for awhile... ,10
JIJI,Which way are we going? ,5
KIKI,To the south where we can see the ocean. ,9
KIKI,Jiji! Turn on the radio my hands are busy! Hurry! ,10
KIKI,Good evening. ,2
WITCH,Well well...Are you a newcomer? ,5
KIKI,Yes I just departed this evening. ,6
WITCH,Would you mind turning off that music? I like to fly in silence. ,13
KIKI,Oh. Is it hard to settle down in a strange town? ,11
WITCH,Well there were problems. But I can tell fortunes so it's going all right. ,14
KIKI,Fortune-telling... ,1
WITCH,And lately I've been telling love-fortunes. ,6
KIKI,Really? ,1
WITCH,What's your specialty? ,3
KIKI,Well I've been thinking about various things. ,7
WITCH,Oh? I'll be through with my training soon. I'm so glad I can return home with my head held high. That's my town. It's not big but it's all right. And you too do your best. ,36
KIKI,I will. ,2
WITCH,Well bye! ,2
JIJI,What a snob! Did you see that cat? Ehh... ,9
KIKI,A specialty... ,2
KIKI,What the...! That weather report!! ,5
JIJI,That's no good! It's a freight train. ,7
KIKI,Let's rest a bit until the rain stops. ,8
JIJI,Won't we get a scolding? ,5
KIKI,Well if we're discovered. I'm soaking wet. ,7
JIJI,Is it swaying? ,3
KIKI,Um...it smells good. ,3
KIKI,Sorry I didn't know it was your dinner. ,8
KIKI,Jiji it's the sea the sea! How wonderful! It's my first view of the sea! ,15
JIJI,Big deal! It's just a lot of water. ,8
KIKI,Look look! A big town! I wonder if there's a witch there? ,12
JIJI,Hmm...I wonder. ,2
KIKI,Here we go. ,3
KIKI,Jiji are you holding on? ,5
KIKI,Look! It's a town right by the sea! A clocktower! I wanted to live in a town like this! ,19
JIJI,But there may be a witch here already. ,8
KIKI,And there may not be. Isn't it beautiful? ,8
JIJI,This town's a little too big. ,6
